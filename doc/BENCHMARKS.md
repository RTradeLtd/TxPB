# Benchmarks

Benchmarks for TemporalX is a constantly evolving process. With our initial release we did a comparison between processing the same workloads in the same environment on go-ipfs and with TemporalX. To read about that check out our [medium post](https://medium.com/temporal-cloud/temporalx-vs-go-ipfs-official-node-benchmarks-8457037a77cf).

From then on we have been maintaining a set of generalized benchmarks through a public github pages site on the TemporalX repository located [here](https://rtradeltd.github.io/TemporalX/) which uses [gobenchdata](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/continuous-benchmarking-for-go) to capture new benchmarks with each release.
