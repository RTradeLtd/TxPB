# Getting Started

## Command Overview

The command line client is called `tex-cli`, and invoking the command without any arguments, or with the `--help`/`-h` flag will display the following information:

**Note: where it says `<VERSION>` will be the git release tag when the binary was built, this is from `v1.0.0-rc4-3-g14ab982`**

Take a look through the various commands to see what you can do.

## Initializing Your Configuration

To create a yaml configuration file, you can use the command `tex-cli config generate` to populate a default configuration file in your curent directory named `config.yml`.

The default setting are set to usable on machines with low memory like raspberry pi's, or other similar devices. If you want to see a configuration suitable for machines with more available resources such as services, see the example config file located in the [config documentation](CONFIGURATION.md).

Make sure you always use a hex encoded private key that is either generated by the tex-cli binary during config initialization, or by yourself securely offline. Do not use any of the ones in the documentation because they are publicly available. These private keys are ed25519 keys as generated by the `go-libp2p-core` crypto library, except they are also hex encoded.

## Starting Your Node

To start your node with the config file located at `/tmp/config.yml` run:

`tex-cli --config /tmp/config.yml server`

If you want to bootstrap against the public libp2p bootstrap servers, and Temporal's public IPFS infrastructure, use the `--bp` flag like so:

`tex-cli --config /tmp/config.yml --bp server`
