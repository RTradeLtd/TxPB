# TxPB

`TxPB` is the main source of information for using TemporalX, and includes protocol buffer definitions, generated code, and documentation. If you are looking for the protocol buffer definitions, check the `pb` folder.

We have pre-generated gRPC bindings for the following languages:

* [golang](https://github.com/RTradeLtd/TxPB/tree/master/go)
* [javascript (grpc-web)](https://github.com/RTradeLtd/TxPB/tree/master/js)
* [java](https://github.com/RTradeLtd/TxPB/tree/master/java/pb)
* [python](https://github.com/RTradeLtd/TxPB/tree/master/py)

If you want bindings in other languages, feel free to open a github issue. Alternatively you can generate language bindings independently as long as the languages you are using support the appropriate protocol buffer and gRPC versions.
